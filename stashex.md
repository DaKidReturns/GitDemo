#This is a File 
This file is for testing the stash command in git cli

This is a text

This was writter over the previous one

This is over wirttern agian after stashing

So, what happes is that when you have items in stash you have to apply one item then
commit and then apply the second item, if confilicts arise then you have to use 
the **confilict resolve method** used in git branching
